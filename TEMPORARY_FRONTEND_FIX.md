# Temporary Frontend Fix

Since the database fixes aren't resolving the issue, let's try a frontend approach to get your application working.

## Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open your application in the browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Look for any error messages, especially:
   - 403 Forbidden errors (RLS policy issues)
   - 404 Not Found errors (missing data)
   - TypeError or undefined errors

## Step 2: Clear Everything

1. Completely log out of your application
2. Clear browser cache:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Select "All time" for time range
   - Check all boxes (Cookies, Cache, etc.)
   - Click "Clear data"
3. Restart your browser
4. Try logging in again

## Step 3: Check Local Storage

1. In Developer Tools, go to Application tab
2. Check Local Storage and Session Storage
3. Look for any Supabase or Auth related entries
4. If you see corrupted data, clear it all

## Step 4: Try Different Browser

Try accessing your application in:
- Incognito/Private browsing mode
- Different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Mobile browser

## Step 5: Check Network Tab

1. In Developer Tools, go to Network tab
2. Reload the page
3. Look for failed requests (red entries)
4. Check the request URLs and response codes
5. Pay special attention to requests to your Supabase backend

## Step 6: Manual Profile Check

If you can access your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Table Editor
2. Check the `profiles` table
3. Verify that your user profiles exist with correct data
4. Check that the `id` field matches your auth user IDs

## Step 7: Force Profile Refresh

Add this temporary code to your AuthContext (around line 50):

```javascript
// TEMPORARY: Force profile creation for testing
useEffect(() => {
  if (session?.user && !profile) {
    console.log('TEMP: Forcing profile check');
    // Try to fetch with relaxed conditions
    supabase.from('profiles').select('*').limit(1).then(({ data, error }) => {
      console.log('TEMP: Relaxed query result:', { data, error });
    });
  }
}, [session, profile]);
```

This will help us understand if the issue is with the specific query or with the data access in general.
