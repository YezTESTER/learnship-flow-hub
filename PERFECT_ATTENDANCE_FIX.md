# Perfect Attendance Bonus Points Fix

## Overview
This document describes the implementation to restore the functionality where learners receive 10 bonus points when uploading a timesheet with 0 absent days.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Updates (DocumentUpload Component)
- Added logic in the [handleUpload](file://c:\Users\Yezreel%20Shirinda\Downloads\APPS\learnship-flow-hub\src\components\documents\DocumentUpload.tsx#L531-L831) function to check for perfect attendance (0 absent days)
- Added a helper function [getPreviousAbsentDays](file://c:\Users\Yezreel%20Shirinda\Downloads\APPS\learnship-flow-hub\src\components\documents\DocumentUpload.tsx#L587-L599) to check previous submission status
- Implemented database function call to award bonus points
- Added fallback mechanism for manual achievement creation

### 2. Database Function
Created `award_perfect_attendance_bonus` function that:
- Checks if a timesheet submission has 0 absent days
- Verifies that the bonus hasn't already been awarded for this specific schedule
- Awards 10 bonus points to the learner's achievements
- Creates a notification for the learner

### 3. Admin Interface Updates
- Enhanced AdminTimesheets component to visually indicate perfect attendance
- Added green checkmark icon for timesheets with 0 absent days
- Improved absent days display with "Perfect Attendance" label

## How It Works

### For Learners:
1. When uploading a timesheet, learner enters absent days (0 if perfect attendance)
2. On successful upload with 0 absent days:
   - System checks if bonus was already awarded for this schedule
   - If not, calls database function to award 10 bonus points
   - Shows success message: "Perfect attendance! +10 bonus points awarded."
3. Learner receives achievement badge in their profile

### For Admins:
1. In the Admin Timesheets view, schedules with 0 absent days show:
   - Green checkmark icon next to submission status
   - "Perfect Attendance" label instead of absent days count
2. Easy visual identification of perfect attendance submissions

## Technical Implementation

### Database Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.award_perfect_attendance_bonus(learner_id UUID, schedule_id UUID)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
  absent_days_var INTEGER;
  already_awarded BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
  -- Get the absent_days for this submission
  SELECT absent_days INTO absent_days_var
  FROM public.timesheet_submissions
  WHERE schedule_id = schedule_id;
  
  -- Check if this learner already received the perfect attendance bonus for this specific schedule
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM public.achievements 
    WHERE learner_id = learner_id
    AND badge_name = 'Perfect Attendance'
    AND description LIKE '%schedule_id: ' || schedule_id || '%'
  ) INTO already_awarded;
  
  -- If absent days is 0 and bonus hasn't been awarded yet, award the bonus
  IF absent_days_var = 0 AND NOT already_awarded THEN
    INSERT INTO public.achievements (
      learner_id,
      badge_type,
      badge_name,
      description,
      points_awarded,
      badge_color,
      badge_icon
    ) VALUES (
      learner_id,
      'document_upload',
      'Perfect Attendance',
      'Uploaded timesheet with 0 absent days (schedule_id: ' || schedule_id || ')',
      10,
      '#10B981',
      'star'
    );
    
    -- Also create a notification
    PERFORM public.create_notification(
      learner_id,
      'Perfect Attendance Bonus!',
      'Great job! You earned 10 bonus points for submitting a timesheet with perfect attendance.',
      'success'
    );
  END IF;
END;
$$;
```

### Frontend Logic
```typescript
// Award bonus points for perfect attendance (0 absent days) for timesheet uploads
if (uploadTarget?.type === 'work' && absentDays === 0) {
  // Check if this is the first time this timesheet is being uploaded with 0 absent days
  if (!wasAlreadyUploaded || (oldDocPath && absentDays !== (await getPreviousAbsentDays(uploadTarget.periodId)))) {
    // Call the database function to award the bonus
    try {
      const { error: bonusError } = await supabase.rpc('award_perfect_attendance_bonus', {
        learner_id: user.id,
        schedule_id: uploadTarget.periodId
      });
      
      if (bonusError) {
        console.error('Error awarding perfect attendance bonus:', bonusError);
      } else {
        toast.success('Perfect attendance! +10 bonus points awarded.');
      }
    } catch (bonusError) {
      console.error('Exception awarding perfect attendance bonus:', bonusError);
      // Fallback to manual achievement creation
      await supabase.from('achievements').insert({
        learner_id: user.id,
        badge_type: 'document_upload',
        badge_name: 'Perfect Attendance',
        description: 'Uploaded timesheet with 0 absent days',
        points_awarded: 10,
        badge_color: '#10B981',
        badge_icon: 'star'
      });
      toast.success('Perfect attendance! +10 bonus points awarded.');
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. Upload timesheet with 0 absent days → Should receive 10 bonus points
2. Upload timesheet with >0 absent days → Should NOT receive bonus points
3. Update existing timesheet from >0 to 0 absent days → Should receive bonus points
4. Update existing timesheet from 0 to >0 absent days → Should NOT affect previously awarded points
5. Upload multiple timesheets with 0 absent days → Should receive 10 points for each

### Expected Results
- Learners see "+10 bonus points" toast message for perfect attendance
- Achievements table shows "Perfect Attendance" badge with 10 points
- Admin interface shows visual indicators for perfect attendance
- No duplicate bonus points for the same schedule

## Deployment
1. Apply the database migration `20251012170000_award_perfect_attendance_bonus.sql`
2. Deploy the updated frontend files:
   - `src/components/documents/DocumentUpload.tsx`
   - `src/components/admin/AdminTimesheets.tsx`

## Support
If learners report not receiving bonus points:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database function is working correctly
3. Check that absent days are being recorded as 0
4. Verify that the schedule_id tracking is working properly
