  - Status (submitted first or pending first)
  - Absent days (lowest or highest)

### 4. Bulk Management Features
- Checkbox selection for individual records
- Select All functionality for bulk operations
- Clear selection button to reset selections
- Visual highlighting of selected rows

### 5. Data Export Functionality

- Export only selected records to CSV
- Comprehensive CSV format including all relevant data fields

### 6. Improved User Experience
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Intuitive filter and sort controls
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Clear status indicators with appropriate icons

## Technical Enhancements
