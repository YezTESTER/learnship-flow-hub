# Git Commit Instructions

To commit and push the changes we've made, run these commands in your terminal:

## 1. Check the status of your changes
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Yezreel Shirinda\Downloads\APPS\learnship-flow-hub"
git status
```

## 2. Add all changed files
```bash
git add .
```

## 3. Commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "Fix authentication issues and restore application functionality"
```

## 4. Push to your repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

## If you have multiple remotes, specify which one to push to:
```bash
git push origin main
# or
git push upstream main
```

## If you need to pull first (in case there are remote changes):
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

## To see your commit history:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

## If you want to see what changes will be committed before committing:
```bash
git diff --cached
```

## Common Issues and Solutions:

**If you get "fatal: not a git repository":**
Make sure you're in the correct directory where your .git folder is located.

**If you get "Permission denied" errors:**
Make sure you have write permissions to the repository directory.

**If you get "Updates were rejected":**
Try pulling first: `git pull origin main` then push again.

**If you want to commit only specific files:**
```bash
git add src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx
git add supabase/migrations/20251017180000_rollback_broken_rls_policies.sql
git commit -m "Fix specific files"
git push origin main
```
