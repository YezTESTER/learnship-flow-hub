# Timesheet Expiration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the automated timesheet expiration system that manages bi-weekly timesheet submissions with a 2-month retention period.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `expiration_date`, `download_count`, and `is_expired` columns to `timesheet_submissions` table
- Created database functions for automatic expiration management
- Added indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Admin Interface Enhancements
- Added "Expired" status filter option
- Implemented UI indicators for expired timesheets (gray badge with lock icon)
- Disabled view/download buttons for expired timesheets
- Added expiration date and download count to export data
- Added "Expired" statistic to summary dashboard

### 3. Learner Interface Updates
- Added "Expired" badge for expired timesheets
- Disabled "View" and "Update" buttons for expired timesheets
- Display expiration date in timesheet cards
- Clear visual indication of expired status

### 4. Backend Logic
- Automatic expiration date setting on timesheet upload (2 months from upload date)
- Download count tracking when admins access timesheets
- Daily job to mark expired timesheets
- Weekly job to delete expired files from storage
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
1. `supabase/migrations/20251013150000_timesheet_expiration_management.sql` - Database schema and functions
2. `src/jobs/expireTimesheets.ts` - Background job scripts
3. `TIMESHEET_EXPIRATION_SYSTEM.md` - Documentation
4. `TIMESHEET_EXPIRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Existing Files Updated
1. `src/components/admin/AdminTimesheets.tsx` - Admin interface changes
2. `src/components/documents/DocumentUpload.tsx` - Learner interface changes

## How It Works

### Timesheet Upload Process
1. When a learner uploads a timesheet, the system automatically sets the expiration date to 2 months from the upload date
2. The timesheet is immediately available for admin review

### Admin Access Tracking
1. Each time an admin views or downloads a timesheet, the download count is incremented
2. This ensures admins have accessed the timesheet before potential expiration

### Expiration Workflow
1. A daily background job checks for timesheets that have passed their expiration date
2. Expired timesheets are marked with the `is_expired` flag
3. A weekly background job deletes the actual files from storage
4. Database records are retained but file paths are cleared

### User Interface Behavior
1. Expired timesheets show a "Expired" badge with a lock icon
2. View/Download buttons are disabled for expired timesheets
3. Special styling (reduced opacity) indicates expired status
4. Export functions include expiration date and download count information

## Benefits Achieved

### Storage Management
- Automatic cleanup of timesheet files after 2 months
- Predictable storage usage patterns
- Reduced long-term storage costs

### Compliance
- Ensures timesheets are available for the required review period
- Maintains audit trail with database records
- Clear policy for data retention

### User Experience
- Transparent expiration process with clear indicators
- No unexpected loss of accessible timesheets
- Consistent behavior across admin and learner interfaces

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Upload a timesheet and verify expiration date is set correctly
2. Access the timesheet as admin and verify download count increments
3. Manually mark a timesheet as expired and verify UI changes
4. Attempt to access an expired timesheet and verify it's blocked
5. Export data and verify expiration information is included

### Automated Testing
1. Verify background jobs execute successfully
2. Check database flags are set correctly
3. Confirm storage usage trends match expectations

## Deployment Notes

### Migration Execution
The database migration should be run as part of the normal deployment process. It is backward compatible and will not affect existing data.

### Background Job Scheduling
The background jobs should be scheduled to run:
- Daily: `check_and_mark_expired_timesheets()`
- Weekly: `delete_expired_timesheet_files()`

### Monitoring
Monitor the execution of background jobs and check for proper expiration flag setting in the database.

## Future Considerations

### Enhancements
1. Email notifications to admins before timesheet expiration
2. Configurable expiration periods by learner category
3. Detailed analytics on timesheet access patterns
4. Manual override capability for special circumstances

### Maintenance
1. Regular monitoring of background job execution
2. Periodic review of storage usage trends
3. User feedback collection on the expiration process
